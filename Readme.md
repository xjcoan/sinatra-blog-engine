# Sinatra Blog Engine
A simple markdown blog engine/HTML content delivery system made in Sinatra!

## How's it work?
Simple! Just make your blog/content page in the `views folder` with a file name
that represents the title of your page like so: `myblog.md`.  This blog will then
be located at the path `/blog/myblog`.

### How do I run it?
First, clone it and bundle (obviously ðŸ˜‰).
Second, run `rackup -p 3000` and visit 'localhost:3000' in your favorite browser to see the content.


### Can I use this?
Sure, go wild.  Props to the team at Sinatra and rdiscount for the tech that really makes this work.
